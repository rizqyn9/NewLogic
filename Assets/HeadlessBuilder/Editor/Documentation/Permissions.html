If you get an error saying Headless Builder does not have <b>write permissions</b> for your project folder, then something is unnecessarily blocking access to your project files.<br><br>

This is unfortunately a problem that is out of Headless Builder's hands.<br><br>

These are ways people have resolved this issue:<br><br>

- Make sure you run the Unity Editor as administrator.<br>
- Make sure your project folder isn't read-only.<br>
- Make sure you have some free disk space.<br>
- Whitelist your entire project folder in your antivirus software or turn it off altogether.<br>
- Turn off Windows Defender.<br>
- Disable file sharing tools such as Dropbox.<br>
- Manually delete the "headless_builder_backup" folder, if it exists.<br>
- Restart Unity.<br>
- Restart your computer.<br>
- Re-install Unity.
