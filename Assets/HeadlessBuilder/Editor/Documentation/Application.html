If your headless build does not have a <b>target framerate</b>, it will heavily load your CPU trying to reach Unity's default of 1000 FPS.<br>
If you don't already set your application's target framerate elsewhere, configure one in the settings tab.<br><br>

Even in headless mode, Unity will render all your active cameras, sending the resulting graphics to a virtual buffer where they are discarded.<br>
Headless Builder can dynamically <b>disable all your cameras</b>, including any camera that you might create or enable using scripts.<br><br>

Unity saves any <b>log messages</b> generated by your application to the default Unity log file somewhere on the user's computer.<br>
Headless Builder can output these log messages to the console instead, which makes debugging and monitoring more convenient.
