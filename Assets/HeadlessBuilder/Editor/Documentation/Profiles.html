A <b>profile</b> is simply a collection of your headless build's settings. By creating multiple profiles, you can do various headless builds with different settings.<br><br>

Creating, selecting or deleting a profile is very simple. Just use the three corresponding buttons in the settings tab.<br><br>

You should give each profile a simple name, so you can easily find them later. The profile name will also be used to name your build's executables.
