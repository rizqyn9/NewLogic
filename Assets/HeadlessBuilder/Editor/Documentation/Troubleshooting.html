If enabled, some features modify assets or scenes when you do a headless build. The originals are restored after the build is complete. If however Unity is somehow terminated before then, some files may become damaged.<br><br>

If this happens, all you have to do is restore the backup from the folder "<b>headless_builder_backup</b>". Copy its contents over your project folder, overwriting the existing files.<br><br>

<i>Note:</i><br>
This is just a precaution to keep your files safe. You should normally never need this.
